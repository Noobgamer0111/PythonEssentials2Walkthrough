# Python is capable of accessing data in stored files, regardless of media type.
# This is done through the use of file streams. A file stream is a sequence of data that is accessed 
# in a sequential manner. The data is read or written to a file, and the file is accessed as a
# stream of data.

# A typical Python script can be used to process images, perform mathematical calculations, and
# and calculate statistics.
