# Python is capable of performing the file operations on the file, regardless of the file naming scheme.
# E.g. Python can perform read and write operations on an opened file.

# Modes to open a stream in Python:
# 'r' - read mode
# 'w' - write mode
# 'a' - append mode/update mode i.e. both read and write to the file.
